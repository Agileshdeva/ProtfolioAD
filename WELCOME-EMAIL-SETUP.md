# Welcome popup – visitor log (Netlify)

When a visitor enters their name and clicks **Get in**, their **name** and **login time** are saved as a log in **Netlify Forms**. No email is sent.

## Viewing the log

1. Open your site on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com).
2. Go to **Forms** in the left sidebar.
3. Click the **welcome** form.
4. You’ll see every submission with **visitor-name** and **login-time** (ISO timestamp). You can export or revisit this list anytime.

No extra setup is required as long as the site is deployed on Netlify.
